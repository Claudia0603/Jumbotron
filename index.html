                <h1><b>Soccer</b></h1>
                <p>I have played soccer since I was about 3 years old. I played in JAWS till I was 7 then I
                    joined the Wolves. When my baby brother was born I left the wolves because it was a travel league. I
                    then played for my middle school.
                    I went to tryouts my freshman year and then didn't make the team, but this year I tried again and
                    made it. I can't really to you why I like soccer but when I play
                    it just makes me happy even if I lose a game or two. Plus the friends I have from playing soccer are
                    the best.</p>

                <h1><b>Volunteering at my Church</b></h1>
                <p>I volunteer at my Church's nursery and take care of little kids while there parents go to "Big
                    Church". I do it for Community Service but I love it. I normally watch 3 to 4
                    year olds, but if another age group needs me I help them. I read books to them, play cars, kitchen,
                    dinosaurs, whatever they want to do. I have always loved little kids and
                    volunteering in the nursery allows me to have fun with them and get my service hours.
